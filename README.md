## Supervised Contrastive Framework for Re-Identification with Inpainting 

<hr>

- This repository implements a Supervised Contrastive Framework for Re-Identification with Inpainting, leveraging ResNet as backbone model. The framework integrates inpainting techniques and custom augmentations, enhancing feature robustness and re-identification accuracy. The pipeline is designed for end-to-end learning and supports image preprocessing, feature extraction, and feature dimensionality reduction.

## Augmentations ðŸ“˜
The framework applies the following augmentations during preprocessing to improve model generalization and robustness.

## Feature Extraction ðŸ“˜
- Backbone Model: Supports ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer (ViT) for feature extraction.
- Projection Head: Reduces feature dimensionality using a two-layer projection head, improving computational efficiency while preserving feature quality.
